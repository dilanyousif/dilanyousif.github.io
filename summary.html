        Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years. Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals. As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it. Over all years, technological advancements have made it possible for people to use a safer technology to modify genes. This tchnology is called CRISPR, and it has the potential to change humanity forever. 
        It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is. One, only if they do so can they activate their most effective antivirus system: they save a part of the virus DNA in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR. Here it's stored safely until it's needed.When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive and arms a secret weaponâ€”a protein called CAS9. The protein now scans the bacterium's insides for signs of the virus invaderby comparing every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive. When it finds a 100-percent perfect match,it's activated and cuts out the virus DNA, making it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack. What's special is that CAS9 is very precise, almost like a DNA surgeon.
        The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable. You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living cell. If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells,to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences. It also works for every type of cell: microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans. But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first generation tool. More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak.
